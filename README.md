This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in ActionScript: the silent failure when accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.  ActionScript does not throw an exception; instead, it returns undefined. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors. The bug.as file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.as offers a solution using a simple bounds check.
